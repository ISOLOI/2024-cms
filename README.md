# MBH blog

## Site contains aggregated articles published over the years from a varity of revisions I constantly implemented.theme

- Who would waste countless hours caring aboout updating a stupid blog site?

I got caught up in creating custom CMS apps early on, then JAMSTACK blew up, and I favored new trends as they appeared.theme
 I wish I would have just leaned on deploying content, but I have a tick for checking what's under the hood with the collection of different approaches. Plus Netlify made it super easy to change up how I maintained the content, so i went down a needless rabbit hole. theme
 Sadly the bubble burst and it seems like nobody discusses the headless CMS wars.theme

 Anyway, If you read this much, Im sure you are researching my CV and I hope you see a broad picture of a curious dev that continues playing with codebases for knowledge instead of only focusing on what's considered 'hot".theme
